# Code Quality Standards

## Code Style

- Write clean, readable code
- Avoid over-engineering - implement only what's requested
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript types effectively

## UI Libraries

### Icons

- Use [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for all icons
- Install: `npm install lucide-react`
- Import icons as needed: `import { Search, X, Menu } from 'lucide-react'`
- Keep icon sizes consistent (use className for sizing)
